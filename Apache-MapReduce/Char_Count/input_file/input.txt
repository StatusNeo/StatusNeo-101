The HIVE is developed by the Data Infrastructure team of Facebook. At Facebook, Hive's Hadoop cluster is capable to store more than 2 Petabytes of raw data, and daily it processes and loads around 15 Terabytes of data. Now it is being used by many companies also. Later, the Apache Foundation took over Hive and developed it further and made it an Open Source. It is also used and developed by other companies like Netflix, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), etc.
